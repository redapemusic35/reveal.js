## What is Non-Cognitivism?

> "Mental states expressed by moral claims are non-cognitive attitudes which cannot be true or false."

Note:

Hume was a skeptic. However there are competing views as to specifically what his skepticism amounted to. One version of Humean skepticism which I will address, involves Hume’s skepticism about moral knowledge. In some interpretations, Hume’s response to his own skepticism would have us deny moral knowledge.

One argument as to what kind of moral knowledge skepticism Hume held is treated by Sarah McGrath in her coming book “Moral Knowledge.” In the chapter “Losing Moral Knowledge [@mcgr19a, 151—186],” she presents the following argument:

## McGrath's Argument

### Premise 1

1. Any source of ordinary empirical knowledge is also a potential source of moral knowledge.

Note:

Why might this not be true? Who says that it isn't true. Namely, non-cognitivist. However, an easy reply is that ordinary moral knowledge does not merely have to be empirical. Camil Golub [@golu19a] argues that the non-cognitivist argument relies on an unfair language attribution. That when cognitivist use propositional statements, they are not referring to anything. However a proposition such as, your action *x* makes me feel *y*. As such they might be making a moral claim which can be true or false. Therefore propositional statements used by cognitivists do have meaning and furthermore, can be true or false.

### Premise 2

2. Humean skepticism would have us believe that our efforts to acquire and maintain moral knowledge are not susceptible to frustration in all the ways that our efforts to acquire and maintain ordinary empirical knowledge are. As such, given that moral knowledge cannot be undermined in the same way as empirical knowledge, then moral knowledge cannot be had.

### Premise 3

3. Could moral claims be disputed?

Note:

However, Dworkin offers a response which says that undermining moral beliefs requires an argument which targets that conviction [@mcgr19a, 188] and given Hume’s principle that an ought cannot be derived from an is, “the content of moral and non-moral claims is so different that any such argument whose premises consist of non-moral claims will fail to make contact with its intended target. Therefore, the discovery of purely non-moral information could never provided the premises of a successful skeptical argument [@mcgr19a, 188].

## Rebutting and Undercutting

Note:

A common objection to moral knowledge then, includes making and considering the distinction between a rebutting defeater and an undercutting defeater. A rebutting defeater undermines your justification for believing a proposition *p* by “providing evidence for *not-p* [mcgr19a, 172].” For instance, consider the following example:

### Extraordinary Evidence

> Assume that you have a coin. You know that the coin is in fact fair meaing that you presume that the coin will land “heads” 50 percent of the time more or less when flipped normally. You flip the coin repeatedly and watch as it lands “heads” consecutively for some large number of times. You may assume that the current number of times which the coin has landed “heads” is merely an extroadinary but not improbable sequence of outcomes. You continue to flip the coin however, and as the number of times the coin lands “heads” continues to grow, you will no longer be in a position to know that the coin is fair.[@mcgr19a, 172]

Note:

Here you are not in a position to know that the coin is fair because you received further evidence (the increase in the number of times which the coin lands “heads”) that supports a contrary proposition, that it is not likely that the coin is fair. Each time that the coin lands “heads” above and beyond the “extraordinary improbable sequence of outcomes,” represents evidence supporting the position that it is unlikely the coin is fair.

#### But...

> On the other hand, an undercutting defeater does not provide evidence for *not-p*, but rather undermines your justification in other ways. One common way addressed by McGrath, is by showing that one’s reasons for believing *p* are unrelated to the truth of *p*. First, consider what we might call the *etiology* of the belief in question.

</script>
</section>
<section data-markdown data-background='#498' data-transition='concave' data-background-transition='linear'>
<script type="text/template">

Imagine that your evidence for believing the coin landed “heads” an extraordinarily large number of times, is your seeming remembrance of watching the coin land “heads.” 

Note:

Here, the etiology of your belief would be your seeming remembrance of watching the coin land “heads.” Further, notice that this implies that etiology of a belief can be quite broad and include a number of factors; in this case, the etiology is our memory of a particular event. However, consider another possibility; that you were hypnotized to believe that you remember watching the coin land “heads.” The etiology of the belief would then be your hypnotization. If you came to believe this second fact, that you were hypnotized, then you would have an undercutting defeater for your belief. Here, your possible hypnotization does not support any belief contrary to your belief that the coin landed “heads” and extraordinary number of times.

<script type="text/template">

The difference between the rebutting defeater and the undercutting defeater, is that the undercutting defeater does not give you any evidence against your belief that *p*. 

Note:

After all, it is quite possible that though your were hypnotized, you did in fact, watch the coin land heads an extraordinarily large number of times. However, your belief about your potential hypnotization, undercuts your justification for your belief that the coin isn’t fair. It undermines your justification for believing *p* while not giving you evidence for *not-p* [mcgr19a, 172].

A common defense of skepticism regarding claims about moral knowledge, is that undercutting defeaters do not undermine one’s justification for believing *moral-p* in the same way that it does for ordinary *empirical-p*.

Note:

McGrath argues that Ronald Dworkin’s distinction between the underminability of moral claims as distinct from the underminability of non-moral claims.

According to McGrath, Hume argues that Hume’s principle “ensures our moral beliefs cannot be rationally undermined by arguments from non-moral premises...”[@mcgr19a, 187]

4. However, this might have as much to do with our perception as it does of our observations. (moral psychology)

5. Given that our perceptions of our empirical evidences can be shown to be misguided at times (motivation for skepticism), we ought to practice certain virtues (motivations for a kind of rational sentimentality (normative sentimentalism ality) in practice).
